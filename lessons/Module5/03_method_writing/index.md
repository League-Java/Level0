2. Make a new class, create a main method, and show the robot.
3. Have the robot draw a square.
4. Put this code into a drawSquare() method.
5. Have the robot draw a triangle.
6. Put this code into a drawTriangle() method.

### Goal:

Write methods to represent the activities that will make the user's pet happy.

### Steps:

1. Ask the user to enter the type of pet they want (give them a few choices).
2. Use a loop (maybe a while loop?) to keep offering interactions with their pet until the desired pet happiness level has been reached. Examples of activities are:   Feed, Walk, Play
3. Write a method for each of the pet activities offered. Each activity should increase (or decrease) the pet's happiness level by a different amount, depending on the kind of pet they have. For example, a fish might not enjoy a walk!
