Print out all the years you have been alive (e.g. 2005, 2006, etc).	Use a for loop and the for loop variable should be the year

### Steps:

1. Use a for loop to print out all of the years you have been alive. Use the for loop variable in your print statement.

### Goal:

Use input from a user to control the number of repetitions of a for loop.

### Steps:

1. Call the playMisterZee method. Run the program to make sure it works.
2. Ask the user how many shiny objects they would like
3. Use a for loop that repeats the method call for as many times as the user specified.




## Robot Walk of Fame

### Goal:

Use a for loop to make a robot draw a line of stars.

### Steps:

1. Create a Robot and place it at the left of the window.
2. Write code so the Robot draws a 5-point star (Hint: turn angle will be 144)
3. Use a for loop to repeat the above code so a line of stars is drawn across the window (see image).
